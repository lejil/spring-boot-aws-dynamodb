# Spring Boot AWS DynamoDB Integration
* This project demonstrates the integration of AWS DynamoDB with a Spring Boot application. It showcases how to perform CRUD operations on a DynamoDB table using the AWS SDK within a Spring Boot microservice. The goal is to provide a simple yet robust implementation for interacting with a fully managed, highly scalable NoSQL database in the AWS ecosystem.

# Key Features:
* CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on DynamoDB tables.
* AWS SDK Integration: Leverages the AWS SDK for seamless communication with DynamoDB.
* Spring Data DynamoDB: Simplified interaction with DynamoDB through repository patterns.
* Local DynamoDB Setup: Option to run DynamoDB locally for testing and development.
* Custom Query Support: DynamoDB queries and scan operations to retrieve filtered data.

# Tech Stack:
* Spring Boot 3.x
* AWS SDK for Java
* DynamoDB
* Maven
* Java 17
* This project provides a solid foundation for developing cloud-native applications with AWS DynamoDB and Spring Boot.
